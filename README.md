# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

This project demonstrates the differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java. For this Array i used strings instead of values.

## Array Example

- Arrays are fixed in size.
- Direct access to elements with constant time complexity.
- Code provided demonstrates creating an array, populating it, and iterating over its elements.

## ArrayList Example

- ArrayLists are dynamic in size.
- Provides additional methods for manipulating the list, such as `add()`, `remove()`, and `get()`.
- Example code provided demonstrates creating an ArrayList, populating it, adding more elements, and iterating over its elements.

## Java Code

The Java code in `DifferenceArrayLists.java` shows examples of both arrays and ArrayLists.

## Instructions

1. Compile: `javac DifferenceArrayLists.java`
2. Run: `java DifferenceArraysArrayLists`
